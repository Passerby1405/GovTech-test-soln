2.1 I want to find out the top 3 car manufacturers that customers bought by sales (quantity) 
and the sales number for it in the current month.

SELECT all_sales.manufacturer, all_sales.sales_quantity, COALESCE(month_sales.month_sales, 0) FROM
        (
	SELECT e.manufacturer, COUNT(manufacturer) AS sales_quantity FROM sales s 
        LEFT OUTER JOIN model d 
    	ON s.serial_number = d.serial_number
        INNER JOIN model_details e 
        ON d.model_name = e.model_name
        GROUP BY e.manufacturer
        ORDER BY sales_quantity DESC
        LIMIT 3
	) AS all_sales
        
        LEFT OUTER JOIN
        (
	SELECT e.manufacturer, COUNT(e.manufacturer) AS month_sales FROM sales s 
        LEFT OUTER JOIN model d 
    	ON s.serial_number = d.serial_number
        INNER JOIN model_details e 
        ON d.model_name = e.model_name
        WHERE (SELECT date_part('month', (s.time_of_sale))) = (SELECT date_part('month', (SELECT current_timestamp)))
        GROUP BY e.manufacturer) AS month_sales
        ON all_sales.manufacturer = month_sales.manufacturer;
